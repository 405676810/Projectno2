# Responsive Sign-Up Form

## Project Overview
This project implements a responsive sign-up form for a fictional application named "Neva". The form allows users to create an account by entering their email and password. It is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, with clear instructions and validation for password requirements.

## Files Included
- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage, including the sign-up form and links for existing users.
- **css/styles.css**: The stylesheet that defines the visual appearance of the webpage, including layout, colors, and responsive design.
- **js/script.js**: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the sign-up form, including validation and navigation to the login page.

## Features
- Responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes.
- Clear input fields for email and password.
- Instructions for password requirements with dynamic feedback.
- Link for users who already have an account to navigate to the login page.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the sign-up form.
3. Ensure that the `css/styles.css` and `js/script.js` files are correctly linked in the HTML for proper styling and functionality.

## How to Run
Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser. The sign-up form will be displayed, and you can interact with it to test the functionality.

## Future Improvements
- Implement server-side validation for email and password.
- Add more fields to the sign-up form, such as username and confirm password.
- Enhance the user experience with animations and transitions.
